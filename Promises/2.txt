promises object are immutable (best)

promises are async

container for the future value

promises save us from callback hell can be done with the help of promise chaning


promises are objects eventuaal completion of an async operation.


see screenshots for promise chaning.

1. What are Promises?
Promises are objects which are used to perform asynchronous operations. They are just like placeholders to store a future value that will be returned after some time. They contain two properties: PromiseState and PromiseResult.

 2. Importance of Promises:
a) Promises can help us to write trust worthy code.
b) Promises are used to solve the problems of callbacks like inversion of control and callback hell.
c) They give us the result prompt in three states: 1) Pending 2) Fulfilled 3) Rejected
d) We can attach function to promise object and retrieve its value unlike callbacks no need to pass the function.
e) Nesting can be done in Promises and with the help of that we can return the values in each individual chain.


Thank you bhaiya, for this awesome explanation of Promises.
